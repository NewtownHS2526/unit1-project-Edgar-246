    <h2>About Mahatma Gandhi</h2>
    
    <p>Mahatma Gandhi was born on October 2 in 1869 in the state of Porbander. During this time Britain was in control of India and many people were treated unfairly due to laws that were created. When he was 18 he wanted to study law and became a barrister but he failed in many cases. One experiance in his life chnaged everything when he was kicked out of his carriage on first class because of a complain from a white passager. From then on he wanted for all people in his country to be treated equally and to be free from British rule so he started to do something about it. He used acts on non-violence such as peaceful protests and boycotts but also taught many to stand up against this injustice. Due to these protests he was sent to prison many times but it got the British governments attention. These movements had a huge impact and then on August 15, 1947 Indian won it's independence from Britain but sadly on Januray 30, 1948 Mahatma Gandhi was shot and killed by a Hindu extremist. He helped free his country from British rule and his teachings would inspire many people around the world and other activists later on such as Martin Luther King Jr. which would shape our world for how it is today.</p>
